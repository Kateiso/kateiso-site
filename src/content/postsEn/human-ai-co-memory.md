XR production rooms move too fast for brittle project docs. Human–AI Co-Memory (HACM) keeps the room aligned by binding emotional intent with structured prompts. Every rehearsal captures:

- **Feel** — the human note about mood, tension, and context.
- **Frame** — AI-generated bullet points summarizing blockers or highlights.
- **Flow** — the motion cues and haptics we want to test next session.

By letting AI handle the Frame and Flow drafts, the human producer focuses on real-time sensing. Agents then turn these drafts into reminders for the next XR walkthrough, which means creative partners arrive with the last emotional state still fresh. HACM is less about perfect memory and more about a living, revisable ledger that keeps collaborators honest about what the work is trying to feel like.
