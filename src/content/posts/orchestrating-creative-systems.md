Creative work benefits from clear orchestration layers. Define interfaces, checkpoints, and feedback loops so AI copilots can support—rather than override—human judgment.

### Three layers

- Strategy: goals, constraints, and success signals.
- Orchestration: prompts, tools, and handoffs.
- Execution: content generation, review, and iteration.

Treat prompts as evolving APIs, not one‑off commands.
