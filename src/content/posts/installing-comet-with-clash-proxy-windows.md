When running Comet behind Clash for Windows, the installer may fail to fetch dependencies. The simplest workaround is to launch PowerShell with temporary proxy variables so only the installation session is proxied.

## Steps

1. Open PowerShell (Admin) and export proxy variables:

```powershell
$env:HTTP_PROXY = "http://127.0.0.1:7890"
$env:HTTPS_PROXY = "http://127.0.0.1:7890"
```

2. Run the Comet installer from the same session.

3. Clear variables after install:

```powershell
Remove-Item Env:\HTTP_PROXY; Remove-Item Env:\HTTPS_PROXY
```

This isolates proxy effects and avoids systemâ€‘wide changes.
