The simplest workaround is to launch PowerShell with temporary proxy variables so only the installation session is proxied.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. Open PowerShell (Admin) and export proxy variables:\n\n```powershell\n$env:HTTP_PROXY = \"http://127.0.0.1:7890\"\n$env:HTTPS_PROXY = \"http://127.0.0.1:7890\"\n```\n\n2. Run the Comet installer from the same session.\n\n3. Clear variables after install:\n\n```powershell\nRemove-Item Env:\\HTTP_PROXY; Remove-Item Env:\\HTTPS_PROXY\n```\n\nThis isolates proxy effects and avoids systemâ€‘wide changes.\n\n";
