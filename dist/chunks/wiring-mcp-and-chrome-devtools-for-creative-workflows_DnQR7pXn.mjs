I set up MCP in Codex CLI, brought the Chrome DevTools MCP online, and glued together small n8n flows so the “busywork” parts of creating show up with less weight.\n\n## Why I did this\n\nI’m studying interaction design (BJTU × Lancaster) and building a practice around creative systems. My notes, videos, and posts move faster when the tools hum in the background.\n\n## What clicked today\n\n- MCP in Codex CLI: once providers are configured, Codex reaches local/remote tools through stable interfaces. Less context juggling, more doing.\n- Chrome DevTools MCP: terminal control over the browser makes repeatable checks feel like second nature.\n- n8n helpers: a tiny flow for X posts; another that funnels videos into a notes workspace for quick summaries.\n- A small win: I wrapped a video assignment (ScreenStudio + CapCut) and actually felt good about the pace.\n\n## Notes to future me\n\n- Write prompts like function contracts. They’re living APIs, not one‑offs.\n- Use the tool that’s still moving. DevTools MCP beats older browser automation now.\n- When click paths matter, learn from short videos; they carry the “feel” that docs miss.\n\n### Pointers\n\n- Chrome DevTools MCP: https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp\n- Context/Docs MCPs are great for pulling current docs when coding.\n\n## Tiny automations shipped\n\n- X posting: templates + schedule in n8n.\n- Research capture: auto‑download → summarize in NotebookLM (or similar) → stash for review.\n\n## What worked\n\n1) Plan the day with clear blocks; make tasks smaller than they feel.\n2) A short nap resets the afternoon.\n3) Stack little wins; they add up.\n\n## Could be better\n\n- Proxy rules need trimming; not every site needs it.\n- A small VPS would remove the friction I keep hitting on free tiers.\n\n## Next\n\n- Expand DevTools MCP scripts for QA/data collection.\n- Formalize an “Agent IDE” where the terminal chat and a code model work in parallel.\n- Keep the diary → summary → publish loop alive.\n";
